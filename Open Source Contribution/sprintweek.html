          <h4>Introduction:</h4>
          <p>
            GISMA University recently organized an exciting event called the Skills Sprint Week. 
            This week-long program aimed to provide students with a unique opportunity to enhance 
            their skills in a fast-paced, hands-on learning environment. Through a series of company 
            visits, workshops and guest lectures, students were able to build valuable connections, 
            gain valuable insights and develop essential skills for academic and professional journeys.

            Skills Sprint Week kicked off with a visit to the Bundestag in Berlin, which was a workshop 
            called “Beyond the Borders: Germany's Economic and Sustainable Influence in International 
            Relations.” We were joined by Mr. Knut Abraham, a former Diplomat and a Member of the 
            German Parliament. We dived deep into topics like the impact of war on Germany’s economy, 
            NATO, future plans and some advice on integrating and growing in Germany.

            Next up was a company visit to SAP at Potsdam. Students were given a tour around the 
            building showing their brilliant facility. It was then followed by a presentation on SAP's 
            entire journey to what its future projects and goals are. Students were taken in depth 
            into few of the hot topics of the digital industry like Artificial Intelligence 
            (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud based software. We were also shown the opportunities 
            offered by SAP like some educational learning programs and pathways for students.
